## 4plusone

A simple but entertaining and challening logic game created in React.

## Basic gameplay
<b>Goal:</b> leave the last bubble for the computer.<br><br>
There are a random number of white bubbles between 20 and 35 and in each turn the player can take away 1, 2 or 3 consequent bubbles that will be marked as red. After that, the computer will also take away 1, 2 or 3 consequent bubbles and the process goes on until all bubbles are marked as red.<br><br>
Currently, there are 3 difficutly levels: Dumb, Normal and Hardcore.<br><br>
In dumb mode the computer takes bubbles away randomly, in normal mode it plays the winning startegy in 60% and a random stategy in 40%, while hardcore mode is set to play the winning stategy in 100%.<br>
Since the player always has the opportunity to start the game even hardcore mode can be beaten if the player plays the winning startegy in 100%.
<br><br>
The game was inspired by its Arduino-based version that I saw in a Physics camp in the summer
of 2018.
